148 Pseudo· Tertulliani [cm. 1.

Apostolorum condignam meruit ab apostolo Petro iustamque
sententiam. Hic ausus est summam se dicere Virtutem,
id est, summum Deum ; mundum autem ab angelis stris
institutum ad daemonem se errantem, qui esset Sapientia,
5descendisse quaerendum3 apud Iudaeos se in phantasmate
Dei non passum, sed esse quasi passum.
Post hunc Menander discipulus ipsius, similiter ma·

dixerat, hoc se Menander esse dicebat, negans habere

(Apol. i. 16, 56, Diol. 1203 Euseb. ii. 13), and he is followed by
Irenaeus i. 16; Hippot. Philosoph. vi. 7, 18, 193 Tertull. de caim. 34;
Epiphan. Hoer. 315 Philast. 29; Theodor. Haer. schir. Simon
apparently adopted a current Gnostic terminology and teaching, bnt
added the doctrine of the transmigration of souls in order to enable
him tc identify himself with the Suprema Power and his companion ·
Helena with the female principle. His followers were guilty of the
grossest immoralities. His Christology, like that of all the Gnostics,
was Docetic. He taught that he himself had appeared as Jesus
amongst the Jews.

of all the Gnostio toachers.

first Ennoia, whom he had purchased at Tyre; Iren. i. 16.

Sapientia = rocta of the common Gnostio myths, hers identified
with the fallen Helen, to effect whose deliverance Simon had appeared.

7. Menander. A Samariten toacher in Antioch and a pupil of
Simon, our knowledge of whom is derived from J nstin Martyr Apol.
i. 26, 56, and Irenaeus i. 17: comp. Euseb. iii. 26; Tertull. de anim.
23, 503 de rea. cora. 5. The Menandrianists are named in the list
of Hegesippus3 Euseb. iv. υ.

8. aeque. Leid: ipse reliqui.

quioquid se Simon dixerat. According tc heraeus, whose
ultimate authority was no doubt J nstin Martyr, Menander did not
identify himself, as Simon did, with the Supremo Powsr, Whom he
declared to be unknown to all, but asserted that he himself was
sent as aSaviourformankind311enl.c.

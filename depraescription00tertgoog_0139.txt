124 Ad Scapulam.

hctred which Tertullian had satirically denounced in the
‘Apology'¹ as customary amongst the Romans received
a signal exemplification in the case of these joint rulers; for
little more than a year elapsed before Caracalla contrived his
brother's assassination in his mother's arms, himself assisting
in the bloody dead ². The exiles of Severus' reign had been

Geta⁴, were abetted by the African proconsul Scapula, and
that Tertullian was on these grounds led to address the
present dignified remonstrance to that governor.

The true nature of Christianity appears to be no better

and the persecutors are still ignorant of its aims and doc-
trines. Yet a lostier tone breathes through the condensed
sentences of this Address, the opening chapters of which
admirably epitomize the ‘Apology’ Time had taught Ter-

tendency to see the hand of Divine judgement in the temporal
afflictione which befel persecuting governors and people is
especially marked.

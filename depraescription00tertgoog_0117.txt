102 Ad Martyres.

believing that the writer was not yet committed to the
extravagances of the Eastern heresy.

There is, for instance, no undue exaltation of martyrdom,
no fieroe fanatical joy at the confessors’ prospect of death
Dei caussa ; they are encouraged only to hold themselves
still in the calm steadfast fortitude of patient enduring
saith in their Lord, and in the assurance os tha abiding
presence of His spirit. With this view of martydom it is
only necessary to contrest such Montanistic passages as
‘De Corona’ 1, and almost any page of the treatise ‘De
fuga in persecutione,' in order to see at once the wide
differenoe of tone which pervadas this treatise.

Two other points also mark out this Address from the
Montanistic writings. (ι) The oustom of unrestored penitents
secking libelli from imprisoncd confessors, by whose inter-
cession tha lapsed were wont to be recommended to the
meroiful consideration of the Ohurch ; and (2) the praetiosos
the Church contributing food and money to her imprisoncd

members‚ araboth mentioned (chop. 1) in terme of approval;

whereas both customs are broadly denounoed in Montanistic
treatises—the former de pudicitia 22, and the latter da

ieiwuia 12.

It seems strange that Tertullum, when exhorting the

confessore to eouraga by reminding them of past examples of
fortitude, should make no mention ottho brave witness unto
death borne by the earlier African sufferrem-Namphamo,

and the Soillitan martyre, an. 180 1---and that all his
examplesshould be drawn from paganism. This, however,
may be intentional-‘tanti vitreum, quenti verum mar-
garituml’

Still stranger is it to observo the liberty which was
allowed to the Christiane to openly visit and contributa to
the support of their friends in prison. It is acurions feature
which meets us constantly from the time of st. Paul down to

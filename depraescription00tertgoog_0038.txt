XXXIV. The doctrine of a second God, the Creator, was not
broached before thetime of Marcion, Apelles, and Valen-
tinus, to whom first, no doubt, the truth respecting tha
Divina Nature was revealed! Heretics may therefore
settle their particular dates for themselves. Ifthey date
from Apostolic times or have affinity with such, they
share in tha Apostolic condemnatum if they are not
named by the Apostles, they are condemned on the
ground of their late origin.

XXXV. Heretics can bring none of these objections against the

heretice are named after their own choica, not from
Christ, and therefore, being non-Christiana, they have no
right to the Christian literature, which the Church
holds in har possession by an ancient, true, and assured
blble. (

XXXVIII. The falsification and perversiori of tbe Scripturas wera
affected by the heretice when they began to teacb false
doctrines. The one was necessarytothe other. Inthe

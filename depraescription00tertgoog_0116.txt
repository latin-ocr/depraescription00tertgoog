Tms inspiriting Address has been usually regarded as the
earliest of Tertullian’s Christian writings, composed in the
year an. 197, while the slaughter of Albinus' army near
Lyon (February 27), and the still more terrible massacre of ⁵
his partisans in Rome by Severus’ orders were fresh in the
minds of men 1. But the reference on which this view of
the treatise is based is vagae, and might be interpreted
equally well of the detection and punishment of the ad-
herents of Niger in the East some years lat-ert There is,
however, really no need to seek for the particular instances
of imperial rengeance which may have been in Tertullian's
mind. Any of the earlier years of Severus' reign would
otford examples such as are alluded to ; for punishment as
widely spread as that which this Emperor inflicted could
certainly not have been completed in a single year ³.

The Address contains no traces of Montanism, although
imaginative commentatore have found evidences of a leaning
towards it in the simple allusion to the possibility of
jaalousies and dissensione arising amongst the imprisoned
confessore ⁴. It is scarcely necessary to point ont the
gratuitousness of reading such an idea into the passage3
while there are on the other hand positive reasons for

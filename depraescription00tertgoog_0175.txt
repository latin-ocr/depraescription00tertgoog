160 Pseudo-Tertulliani [eas. lv.

qui cum Valentino per omnis consentiunt. In illo solo
differunt: nam cum Valentinus Aeonas tantum triginta
tinxisset, isti addiderunt alios complures ; quatuor enim
primum, deinde alios quatuor adgregaveruut. Et quod dicit
5Valentinus Aeonem trigesimum excessisse de pleromate, ut
in defectionem, negant isti: nonenim ex illa triacontade
fuisse hunc, qui fuerit in deiectionem propter desiderium
videndi propatoris.
Exstitit praeterea Heracleon alter haereticus, quicum

πνευματικόν. All that is known ol him is derived from Irenaeus
i. 1. 18, 6. 1, and an independent notice in Tertull. cdv. Val. 4.
comp, Philast. 39¹ Epiph. Haer. 33. His characteristic tenet was
the independent personal subsistence, outside the Deity, oi the Aeone
of Valentinus. Some notion of his tecching may be gethered from
the two fragments of his writing preserved in Iren. i. 1. 18 (in
which he deduces tecching on the Ogdoad from the prologus ιο
S. John's Gospel) and in Epiphan. ιο. (a letter ol Ptolemaeus ιο
Flora cn the origin of the Mosaic Law).

secundus. Secundus is the first of the Valentinian Gnostics
described by Irenaeus (i. 5. a), who is followed by Tertullian (adv.
Vol. 38), Hippolytus (vi. 38), and Epiphanius (Haer. 32): cp. Philast.
40; Augustis. Haer. 12. He divided the Valentinian Ogdoad into
two Tetrade, a right and a left, calling the masculine Aeons Light,
and ιιιο feminine Darkness, thus approximating in terminology more
closely than Valentinus to Oriental dualism.

3. isti addiderunt. This is a misunderstanding cn the part cf the
author. Neither Ptolemaeus nor Secundus, whom he here couples
together, made any addition ιο the number of the Valentinian Aeone:
the peculiarity of Secundus’ teaching lay in the grouping of them.

6. negant isti. This exclusicn of the Sophia, whose emotions
gave birth ιο the material world, from the Thirty Aeons, is ascribed tc
Secundus, but not tc Ptolemaeus, hythe authorities cited above.

p. Heracleon. Heracleon was another pupil ol Valentinus;

Origen Uocem. icIoana. ii. 8. His system was more truly philosophical -

than the Valentinian, betraying certain Pythagorean elementa, and
commencing with a Monacl in place of Valentinus' Duad. He
attempted tc use its details in his interpretatione, often wildly
allegorical, ol the Gospcls in his Ὑπομνήματα or ‘Commentarios'
(Orig. a. s. vi. 8). Fragments of these are embedded in Origen's
Commentario on 8. dolam clement of Alexandria’s stromata iv.9

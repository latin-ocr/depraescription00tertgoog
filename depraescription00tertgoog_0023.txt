8 De Praescriptione Haereticorum.

S. Polycarp‚ bishop of Smyrna. The important position
which he occupied in this connexion arises from the fact that
‘in him one single link connected the earthly lise of Christ
with the close ol the second century, though five or six
generations had intervened. S. John, Polycarp, Irenaeus—
this was the succession which gnaranteed the continuity of
the Evangelical record, and of the Apostolic testimony’¹.
The case ol S. Polycarp was a typical one ol the value
of the episcopal succession3 and accordingly we find Hegi-
sippus² carefully noting the Roman succession and bringing
it down to the date of the ‘Memoirs' he was writing3 and
irenaeus appealing to the succession of the bishops from the
Apostles as the grem preservative of the Catholic traditione,
and the great bulwark against heresy³. He claims, too,
for the tecching of these successors of the Apostles an
obedient acceptance, since they received along with their
episcopata the sure gift of the truth ⁴.

It is cleanthen, that the regularly constituted witness of
a continuone personal voice in the episcopata was, as a matter
of history, the method by which the unimpaired integrity of
the Catholic Creed was ensured to succeeding ages. And
lacking back upon the constitution of the early chnrches,
and regarding human nature as we are bound to regard it,
we can see that the episcopata was the one adequate means
for the preservation of the one body of truth. Amid much
that was shisting and transient, the unshaken and permanent
episcopal succession formed a solid phalanx of testimony all
the world over.

It was not unnatural then, since all the true chnrches
could produce the roll of their bishops down from the men

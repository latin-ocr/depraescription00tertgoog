Trns Appendix is not from Tertullianb pen, but is usually
printed along with the treatise ‘De Praescriptionc Haereti-

oorum! In the editions of Gangnaeus, Gelenius, and
Pamelius, it forms an immediate continuation of the last
chapter of that treatise. Rigalt separated it, but without
a fresh heading. It is not found in Codices Apol, Oorb,
Brit. The MSS. which contain it are Laid, Flor. 13,
Mor. 55, Mapl. 527, Mayl. 528, Gora, Vatia, Paterae,
Hireaup. Its title in Laid„ Flor. 55, Mapl. 528, Vatia,
ie Anvnnsus onnus Hennaeus: in Flor. 13, Mapl. 527,
Anvnnws ouuns Hunnnrroos. Parem. gives no title.
It was included by Routh in his Opuscula Scriptorum Eccle-
siasticorum under the title ‘Adversus omnes Haeretioos
Libellus!

The Appendix is now generally believed to be an abridged
Latin translation of the short work of Hippolytus which
Photius (Bit. ooo. 121) calls a Σύνταγμα or ‘Compendium,'
and entlbles Κατὰ αἶρεσὲων βιβλιδάριον ¹. This work of Hippo·
lytus comprised an account of thirty-two heredes, beginning
with the Dosithcans and ending with the Noe'tians. It was
based on some lecturos which he had heard Irenaeus deliver
in Rome, probably about the year 177. Its date would he
certainly earlier than 190. The work itself is lost, but

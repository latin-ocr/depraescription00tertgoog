146 Introduction.

Lipsius has succeeded in partly restoring it bya method
described in his work on Epiphanius cited in the footnote.
The contente of the Appendix agree remarkably with
“ Photius' description of Hippolytus' little treatise. The
heresias enumerated are about thirty-two, beginning with
Dositheus aud ending with Praxeas, whose Patripassianism
was identioal with that of Noc'tus, and who perhaps occupied
a more prominent place in the translator's mind at the time ¹.
The absence of the names of heretics later than Praxeas
makes it probable that the Appendix was subjoined to Ter-
tullian’s treatise sometime about the pontificata of Zephyrinus
(k. n. 199-217) and at Rome, but by whom it is impossible
to determine².

¹ See Christian Remcmtroncer an. 1853, p. ²39· Tertullian’s own
work against Praxeas was largely indebted to Hippolytus’ work against
Noetus ; Noedechen Part. wider Proreus in Jahrb. f. Prot. Theol.
xiv. 576 (1888).

² Oehler conjectured that the Appendix was the work of Victorinus
(martyred 303) oi Patavium, ‘ Adversus omnes Haereses‚’ mentioned by
J erome de oir. illustr. 74. This view has been criticized and rejected
by Dr. Caspari (Plummer's D'dllinger's Hippolytus, p. 357).

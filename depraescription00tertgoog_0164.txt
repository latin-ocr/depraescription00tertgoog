1. in nomine suo baptisatus. By this ‘baptism’ which was
doubtless some form oi magioal incantation (lustin Mart. La), he
taught that a resurrection was assured to his disciples, and that they
would be preserved from death and fromgrowing old 3 Iren. and
Iust. theo

3. Saturninus. A native ol the Syrien Antioeh, and possibly
a pupil oi Menander; iren iii. 4, 3; Tert. deantes. ²3· His name
is variously given aa Σατορνῖνος (Iron, Euseb.), Σατορνεΐλος or
Σατορνῐλος (Hippoi, epiph, Theodec). His system is described by
Irenaeus (i. 18) and by Hippolytus (Philas. vii. 16, 28), both accounts
being probably taken from J ustin Martyr's ‘Syntagma' Comp. Euseb.
iv. 73 Philast. 313 Epiph. Haer. 23; Theodor. Haer. sab. i. 3. He
postulated One Supremo Unknovvn, the Fatber oi all, from Whom
issued a series oi spiritual beings. Orestion was the work of seven
angele, who also made man, a frail creature unable to do more than
wriggle on the ground like a worm until raised by the Suprema Power.
The same myth as to the creation of man is attributed below (chap. 5)
and in Iren. i. 28. 3 to the Ophites, in whose system however the seven
sons of Sophia-Prunikos replaoe the seven mester angele oi Saturninus.
A close affinity can be traced throughout between the Irenaean
Ophites and Saturninus, the latter no doubt having evolved the
original and simpler clemente of the system, Saturninus‘ Christology
was Boeotio, his rule of life Encratite.

4. innascibilem. Oehler quotes Iren. i. 18 ‘Salvatorem autem ·
innatum demonstravit’3 Theodor. Lo. τὸν δὲ Σωτῆρα. . . ἀγγένητον
ἔφησε rol ἀσώματον eal desiisse: but these phrases do not refer to the
First Principle. J unius (rightly 1 think) conjectured ‘innoscibilum,‘
quoting iren. he. ⁸ Saturninus . . . unum patrem incognitum omnibus
ostendit'

6. inferiorem. Rig. following conjecture oss. Uesta: inferiores eei.

9. instituere curasse. The MSS. insert angelos between these
two words.

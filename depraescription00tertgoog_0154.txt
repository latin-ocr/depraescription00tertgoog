eduoation to Proculus instead 11 casalis.

1. clarissimas . . . clarissimos. That Christianity did include
amongst its disciples some persam of rank aud distinction is proved
both by the words 11 Pliny (Epist. x. 96 ‘omnis ordinis ’) written in 112,
and by incidental notioes in other writers: below 111. 5 ‘tui ordinis
viros ’3 see note Apol. 1 z Lightfoot Philippides p. 21, Ipnaltua ii. 186,
196, Clam. 111111. 30.

a. exornavit. The occasion 11 this clemency and protectior seems
to have been on Severus’ eutry into Rome after the victory over Albinus
(reb. 197), when the Christiana were attached by the mob 111 consist-
eutly holdiugaloof from the riotous and 11 them idolatrousdemonstratious

from conjecture, ‘exoneravit’ for the text.

3. Marcus Aurelius, dte. Gomp. Apol. 5. Of 1111 story 11 the
‘Thundering Legion' the historical facts are these. During the intense

Christiane in the army to their own prayers3 by the pagana to the
prayers 11 Aurelius (Capitol. Μ. Ant. Pta'l. ²43 Themistius Orat. 15),
to Jupiter Pluvius (Antou. Column), or 11 the incantatione 11 two magi
Arnuphis and Julian (Dion Oass. lxxi. 8 ffi). The miraculous element
disappears 1111111111 story entirely under scrutiny, and the additions 11
later writers need not be noticed (Oros. vii. 153 Niceph iv. 12). To
the statement 11 Claudius Apollinaris (apud Euseb. v. 5) that the name
‘Thundering Legion' was given by Aurelius 11 the Legion 11 Christian
soldiers, at whose iutercession the relies had been vouchsafed, it is
sufficient to oppose the fact that in the time 11 Nero there was already
a legion so called—the XIlth (011. iii. 30, 60973 Dion Cass. lv. a 3)

diem divini iudicii. Tibi quoque optamus admonitionem
solam fuisse, quod cum Adrumeticum Mavilum ad bestias ,

CAPUT IV.

N ore te terremus, qui nec timemus3 sed velim, ut omnes
salvos facere possimus, mouendo μὴ θεομαχεῖν. Potes et officio
iurisdictionis tuae fungi et humanitatis meminisse, vel quia
et vos sub gladio estis. Quid enim amplius tibi mandatur 10

siege it finally surrendered in 196 to Severus, who inflicted upon its
inhabitants a terrible vengeance; Dion Cass. lxxiv. ιο; Herodian. iii. 6.

christiani gaudete! ‘Gaudetei’ was the congratulatory
formula indicative oi exultation or victory. Rigalt quotes the inscrip-
tion ona gold coin commemorating a victory of Maximian Gauaaru
Roriam. Oomp. Prudent. Cati. xii. 201 ; Martial xi. 61.

3. Adrumeticum Mavilum. Nothing more is known of this
martyr. He is commemorated on lan.4 in the Bollandis Acts.
Adrumetum (medem Susa), a city on the coast 100 miles south of
Karthage, was the capital of the African province of Byzacium. Caes.
B. (l. ii. 233 Liv. xxx. 293 Plin. H. N. v. 4. 3.

ad bestias damnasses. This was contrary to law, see below
ch. 4. The nobly-born Perpetua was thus illegally condemned.

4. et statim haec vexatio, dec. This sentence is very obscure:
laec ceratia may be (1) identical with interpellatio canpainc'c, and then
will probably refer to an attack of illneas which had seiaed the proconsul,
and was now again repeated as a warning3 interpellatio on this view
simply=monitus. Or (a) on the other hand they may be distinguished,
uacatio referring to the destructive rains mentioned above, and interp,
sana. to a new outbrealr of pestilence.

5. interpellatio. The ‘interruption‚’ in the form oi some personal
or public calamity, which put a stop to the governor's persecuting policy.
In the Oxiord translation, however, the phrase has been interpreted quite
differently of the blood of the Christian martyre appealing for justice;
interpellatio being in legal terminology an ‘appeal to the court':
Digest. v. 1. 23, 1. 16. 1.

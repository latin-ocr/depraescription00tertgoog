78 · Tertulliani [cn. xxxnr.

servientes, aliquid Hermogenis ostendit, qui materiam non
natam introducens, Deo non nato eam comparat3 et ita
matrem elementorum deam faciens, potest ei servire, quam
Deo comparat.

5 Ioannes vero in Apocalypsi idolothyta edentes et stupra ι
committentes iubetur castigare. Sunt et nunc alii Nicolaitae.
Gaiana haeresis dicitur. At in epistula eos maxime anti·
christos vocat, qui Christum negarent in carne venisse, et

’ qui non putarent Iesum esse Filium Deir illud Marcion,

1. aliquid Hermogenis: ode. Herm. 4 ‘Hinc denique incipiam
de materia retractare, quod eam Deus sibi comparet proinde non natam,
proinde non iactam, proinde eternam sine initio, sine fine propo-
siam!

5. Apocalypsi. Rev. ii. 14.

6. Nicolaitae. On these heretics, named from Nicolas the Deacon,
whose tecching they probably perverted, see Iren. i. 23, iii. 11. 7, who
is followedby Hippolytus, vii. 36 3 Ps.·Tert. ado. beer. 1 ; Epiph. Haar.
xxv. Clem. Alex. saon. ii. 20, iii.4 (pp. 411, 436, Paris ed.) gives
an independent account quoted by Euseb. H. E. iii. 29, and followedby
Theodora, Haer. fab. iii. 1. The sect is mentioned also Apoet. Const.
vi. 8 ; Ps.·Ignat. Trall. 11 ; Pari. 6, and in every case denounced for its
impurities. Nothing is certainly known oi the Nicolaitans beyond
what is said in the Apocalypse, nor is there any evidence of their
continuauce as a sect after the death oi the Apostle J ohn.

7. Gaiana haeresis. So Ayoh„ Laid, and again oie bapt. 1. The
name takes various forme in different writers, see D. C. B. i. 380, but
the sect is generally known as the ‘ Cainite,’ a branch of the Ophites.
They probably derived their appellation from a current interpretation
of the name ‘Cain'3 Clean. Hom. iii. 25, 4² Κάΐν b ἑρμηνεύεται ζῆλος
(κιρ). Their tenete are described by Irenaeus, i. 28. 9; Ps.·Tert.
odo. tear. 23 Epiph. Haer. 38. They regarded the Creator as an evil
being, and reversed the moral judgements of the Ο. Τ., opposing all
Christian principles and making immorality a necessary part of their
religion. Hence Tertullian terme thern ‘modern N icolaitans.' Harvey,
Irae. i. 214, note 1, has misunderstood Tertullian's words to imply
an identification oi the two sects.

inepistula 1Johniv. 5.
8. carne, carnem, Apob.
9. illud Marcion. Marcion, in aceordanae with his Gnostic be-

liefs, denied that Christ had a real earthly body, or a human birth. Α

The latter would have involved in Marcion’s view Christ's subjection

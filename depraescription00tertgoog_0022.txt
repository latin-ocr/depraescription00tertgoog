witnesses alone could substantiata. Ohrist's Death aud
Resurrection were events which had taken place at a definite
time in the world's history. How, then, amid the natural
tendencies of human thought and belief to disintegration and
change, was the unimpaired tradition of the fundamental
facts of Our Lord's lile, or cardinal doctrines of the saith-

How was the unity of belief, which is of the essence of the
Church’s life, to he preservedt Here again we find exactly
the same kind ol warrant supplied as at the first, namely,
a continuone living voice of personal witness. Tor the
paramount obligation which the Apostles felt to he laid upon
them, as the period of their own witness drew to a close, was

Church intact and unimpaired. Thus S. Paul, on the eve of
his martyrdom, reminds Timothy, his episcopal delegate at
Ephesus, of this his first duty:

‘The things which thou hast heard of me among many
witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall

And the method adopted by S. Paul and Timothy‚ which
is plainly and explicitly laid down in this command, was the
one method which could most effectually secure the end in

guaranteed the identity of the belief of each generation with
that of the preceding, and ensurcd its continuity in the
future. As an illustration‚ we may take the notable case of

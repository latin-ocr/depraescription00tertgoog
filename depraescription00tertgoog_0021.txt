equally often merely 'expresses and emphasized in the readiest
manner those particular articles of the Faith to which the
exigencies of the moment drew special attention. Even at
a later time we find very considerable latitude in quoting
the phraseology of the Nicone symbol—a cerefully-written
and explicit document, in the citation of which, one would

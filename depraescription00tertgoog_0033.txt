es aelf-condemned. He also repeatedly censuros false
doctrines which are the production of heresies.

The word ‘heresy’ is derived from a Greek word meaning
‘choioe,' and refers ιο ιιο sels-willed choice of a doctrine
in opposition to the Rule handed down from Christ by
His Apostles.

VII. Heresies borrow their tenets from philosophy. Valentinus
Is indebted ιο Plato, Marcion ιο the Stoice, Lucanus

to Epicurus, Hermogenes ιο Zeno, Apelles to Heraclitus,
while the Gnostic denial of the Resurrection is common

to all philosophers.

The same questions are discussed by heretice and philo·
sophers: the origin of evil, of creation, of the Creator.
But betwoen the Church and philosophies of every school
there is un irreconcileable antagonism.

VIII. Itis asserted, however, by heretice and ιγ some churchmen

possessed Scriptures which procleimed the Christ. In

the same way the injunctions ‘Kuock, and it shall be '

opened ιο you‚' ‘Ask, and ye shall recere,' were
addressed ιο the Jews who knew where to knock and
from Whom to usk. It was not until the end of His

Ministry that Christ gave any commende about the
Gentiles. The Apostles were taught directly ιγ the
Holy Spirit, and therefore had no need ιο ‘seels' the
truth in order ιο ‘find’ it: still less is there any need of
such an admonition for us who hold the ApostoIIc doctrine.
IX. But even granting that the inJ'unction was for us: the
words must still be interpreted according ιο their con·
text and true purport. hhom these it is clear thot
there is a definite truth revealed by Christ which the
Gentiles are ιο believe, and that they must therefore
seek in order to find it and believe it. Seereh lesds ιο
discovery and dIscovery to belief. The truth taught by

Christ will be found with us.
X. Bellef, which is the goel of ‘seeking and finding? does
away with the need for further search.
There is no finality in heresies, which all urge the same

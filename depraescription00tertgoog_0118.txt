prisoners with each other, with their friends, or with the
lapsed who sought their intercession, seems to have been
unrestricted, or at any rate easily obtainable by bribery⁹.

Cyprian states that it had long been the custorn in Africa
lor the clergy of the Church to have access to the im·
prisoned members of their flock ³, and the Acts of SS. Perpetua
and Felicitas show that they were ableto obtain certain
privileges for them by giving gratuities to the prison officials⁴.
Another passage in the same Acte proves that the large·
powers antrusted to the governor of the prison (optio,
praepositus carceris) might be used at his will sor the ameli-
oration or aggravation of the prisoners' condition ¹⁵. The
whole of thie Address to the Martyre, indeed, is illustrated
inite details by the account of S. Perpetua's ‘Pession’ to
which it bears so many resemblances in tone, in style, and
in diction that the editing of the Acts in their present form ,
hasbeen attributed to 'tertullian himself ⁶. It has been
further conjectured that the ‘Ad Martyrae' *itself was
specially written snd addresscd to Perpetua and her corn-
panions⁷; the conjecture being supported by the following
factet—(e) both groups of martyre contained men as well
as womcn; (b) in both cases the martyre were young in
years; (c) several of Tertullian’s metaphors closely resemble
soenes in the visione of the prisonere. The coincidences are
certainly sufficient to establish the applicability of the
Address to the circumstances of Perpetua and her fellow·
sufferers. Nor is there anything in the treatise itsell to

cmm Church true doctrine ἰι found along with true Scrip-

tures, for the Church has no reason sor interpolating
them. Corruptions of the text are necessarily the work
of later hands, and arise from hostility to the truth.
The cunning oi Valentinus, who perverted the meaning,
made as great havoc of the Scripturcs as did the bold·
ness of Marcion, who excissd the text.

XXXIX. Similar examples of textual manipulation are found in'ths
case oi secular writiugs at the present day. Oeneos
from Virgil and Homer are well known3 much more
readily do the Divino Writings lend themselves to
perverse uses. And purposely so; since ‘heresias must

individual heretic as by the heresiarch, of fashioning his
own belieis. Hence great differeuces exist between the
heresies and their founders. Heretics are outcast wan·
derers, churchless, motherless, homeless, creedless.
XLIII. They associate with magiciaus, quecks, and philosophare,
justifying such conduct by the precept ‘seek and ye

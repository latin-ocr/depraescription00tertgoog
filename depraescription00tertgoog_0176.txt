Valentino paria sentit, sed novitate quadam pronuntiationis
vult videri alia sentire. Introducit enim in primis illud
fuisse quod pronuntiat, et deinde ex illa monade duo, ec

CAPUT V.

Non defuerunt post hos Marcus quidam et Colarbasus
novam haeresim ex Graecorum alphabeto componentes.
Negant enim veritatem sine istis posse litteris inveniri3
immo totam plenitudinem et perfectionem veritatis in istis
litteris esse dispositam. Propter hanc enim caussam 10

onir. V.—-6. Marcus. The Marcosians were a Valentinian sect
noted for their pronounced use of magical incantations, and arithmetical
mysticism, deduced from the numerical value of the letters of the
alphabet, by which they designated the Valentinian Aeone. The
puerilities oi Marcue' system, and his gross charlatanism with a view to
gsining an immoral ascendency over women, are fully described by
Irenaeus i. 7 ff„ who is followedby Hippoi vi. 39; Epiph. Hoer. 34.
Marcus seems to have lived in Asia Minor as a contemporary of
Irenaeus‚ but his teaching was rife also in the neighbourhood oi
Lyon (Iren. Le).

(iolarbosus. It is most probable that this name has misen
from a misunderstanding of an obscure and possibly corrupt passage
in Irenaeus i. 8 Οὗτος οὖν d Mupsds μήτραν καὶ ἐκδοχεῖον τῆς Κυλαρ-

Ι tidros Σιγῆςε and that no heretic so named ever existed. Hippolytus
gives no information about him distinct from Marcus (Psilos. vi. 13
iv. 13); and Philaster treats the teaching of the two heretice as
identical (Hace. 43); while the statements of Epiphanius (Hace. 35)
and Theodoret (Haer. fab. i. 12) are worthless. The word very
possibly represents the Hebrew errabit, Tite Voice os Fore, i.e. oi
ὼε Divina Tetrad which revealed to Marcus the mysteries of Siga.

know, however, that Paul's Gospel was ldentical with
Peter’s and that there was a voluntary distribution of
office between them, that each should preach the same
Gospel but to different persona-Peter ιο the Circum·
cision and Paul to the Gentiles. Paul’s rebuke was for
a fault in conduct, not in teaching.

XXIV. Yet the Apostles’ conduct indeed was not necessarily the
semein all cases, but was adopted to particular cir·
cnmstauces.

(d) Nor did the special revelatione made ιο Paul render
him superior in point ol teaching ιο Peter, for these
were by their nature ineffable.

XXV. (a) The heretical asmrtion that the Apostles taught some
things openly to all, and other things secretly ιο a few is
equally senseless, and involves a false interpretation of
those passages in S. Paul’s wn'tings upon which it is
based (1 Tim, vi. ro, 2 Ilm. i. 14, ii. ο).

XXVI. The Lord's example and commands enjoined the open
preaching of the Gospel in its fulness. And especially
would it be fully taught to churches founded by the
Apostles themselves, whose conduct would otherwise
be deceitful and inconsistent.

XXVII. These two objections having been disposed of there remains
yet a third: (3) the possibility of error on the part of
the churches in their receptior ol the Apostles' teaching.
This is deduccd hythe heretice from the rebulree ad-
ministered by Paul to the Galatiuns and Corinthiam.
But the Apostle's rcproof wrought amendment.

XXVIII. Let it be granted however that all the churches erred;
how comes it that so many churches hit upon the same

errori The very unity of their belief is evidence not
of error, but ol their preservation of a true tradition3
and the authors of the tradition could not be in error.
XXIX. Error, no doubt, prevailed until the riso ol heresiesl the
truth waited for the heretice to declare itl But the
priority of the doctrine of the Ohurch is evidence ol ite
truth, lor the counterfeit cannot precede, but always
follows the genuine.
XXX Marcion and Valentinus lived but a short time ago and
were apostates from the Ohurch. Apelles wasa pupil
ol Marcion's. And this late date oi heresies is prool of

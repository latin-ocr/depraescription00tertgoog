who were appointed hy Apostles, and since such unhrohen

chains formed the security for the faithful transmission of the
true faith, for Tertullian to call upon the heretice to produce
their episcopal suecession as the authority for their teaching.
Nor was it an unfair conclusion that the impossibility of their
complying with this demand proved the falsity and novelty
of their doctrines. The episcopal suecession was in truth
atest of Catholicity, inasmuch as it formed at once the link
with the past, the witness to continuity of life, and the
guarantee of unity of faith.

3. Agreeahly with his line of argument in this treatise,
Tertullian maintains. that the Scriptures are not to he made

as it were; and the futility of an appeal to a literature whose

which had been adopted by Irenaeus, and which was pur·
sued with signal success in later times by Athanasius and
Augustino.

The need of some recognized authoritative interpretation
was clearly felt hy all, and Tertullian urges that the Scrip-

sacred writings (ch. 19). His remarks on the impropriety of
arguing from iselsted texts in disregard of the context, or of
other passages of scripture, will he recognized as alike sound
and acute (ch. 9).

The style of this treatise is far less vehement than that of
the Apology, although instances are not wanting of Ter·

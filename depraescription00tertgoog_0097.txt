82 Tertulliani [osa xxxvi

vocem et repraesentantes faciem uniuscuiusque. Proxima
est tihi Achaiai Habes Corinthum. si non longe es a
Macedonia, habes Philippos. si potes in Asiam tendere,
hahes Ephesum. si autem Italiae adiaces, hahes Romam,
eunde nobis quoque auotoritas praesto est. Ista quam felix
ecclesia oui totam doctrinam apostoli cum sanguine suo pro-
fuderunt: ubi Petrus passioni dominicae adaequatum ubi

simply mean ‘in the genuine text‚’ and not necessarily contain an
implied contrast to the Latin Version. In the present passage, Ter·
tullian no more meant to assert the possession of the Apostolic auto·
graphs by Apostolic Churches than their possession ot the very charis
used by the Apostles.

1. repraesentantes. ‘Repraesentare’ is a legal term, ‘to bring
into court,‘ and so ‘to exhibit a thing and make it present to the
sensas or the mind’ So Apol. 17 (see note), de spect. 17 ; cle paen. 3 ;
ado. More. i. 14 ‘panem quo ipsum corpus suum repraesentat’3 tt.
iv. 22. So ‘ repraesentatio,’ ‘the actuality’ is opposed to ‘visio‚’ ola
coron. 15: op. Pasa. S. Perp. ι ‘quasi repraesentatione rerum,' Teuta
aad Stadios, i. a, p. 9. ·

3. Philippos. Geop, eet, Pam„ Rip. add ‘habes Thessaloni·
censes’; bnt the adJ'eotival form oi the words suggests that they were
the insertion oi a copyist desirous of mentioning the other Macedonian
church to which S. Paul wrote.

4. Romam unde nobis. Ado. Marc. iv. 5 ‘Videamus ... quid
etiam Romani de proximo sonent, quibus evangelium et Petrus et
Paulus sanguine quoque suo signatum reliquerunt.’ The African
Churoh was not founded by an Apostle, but from ltaly. Rome was
therefore its natural authority. Indead as the only ‘Apostolic’
Church oi the West, and in deference to its unique foundation and
history, the Roman Ohurch was generally regarded as the great
depositary of Apostolic tradition (Iren. iii. 3. 1) ; yet still only as ‘one
witness to the nuth: and as standing to the West in no different
position from that of Corinth or Ephesus to their respective localitiea
See Pusey‚ lisele of Fater, p. 31.

6. totam doctrinam, without any reservation such as the heretica
asserted, oh. 25.

7. Petrus adaequatur. Tertullian (here and Scorp. 15) is
the first to relate that S. Peter suffered marty1·dombycrucifixion;
Origen epod Euseb. iii. 1 adds that he was orucified head-downwards.
'l'he martyrdom is mentioned by Olemsnt oi Rome, Ooetntt. 5, but y
neither the place nor the manner is specifico. Dionysius of Corinth
